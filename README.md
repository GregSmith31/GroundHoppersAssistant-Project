# GroundHoppersAssistant-Project
Web Application created in a small team for a Coursework during my studies at Robert Gordon University
Created for Dynamic Web Development CM2104 Coursework at RGU
I have included a video showing what the web app looked like when it was hosted and when connectivity to the SportMonks API was available (they gave us special educational subscription to use during the duration of the coursework which we were extremely grateful for).
